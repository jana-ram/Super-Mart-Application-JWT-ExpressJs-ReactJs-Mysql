# Technical questions

* What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
    i) first thing i submit my code in senior(TL/Manager)  , beacuse coding standared and review it will boost my coding level and carrier too,
    ii) second thing integrate swagger-ui to my application , beacuse no need to maintain documentation. 

* What's your favourite programming language? Why?

    javascript , easily understandable, structure free application creation , higly demanded programming language so i can make it, as my favour. other than javascript i like c++.

* How would you track down a performance bottleneck in an application? Have you ever had to do this?

    excution time of api's , security , use cache concept in application beacuse every time need not go to database ,you can give data from cache memory so application will perform more fastly.
    unwanted database connection should be looking in to more priority.

* How would you deploy your API in a production environment?

    for my own interest i deploy application in docker contatiner , but current working env not availble CI/CD things, so far we deploy application manually , source file has copy to pro server and install dependencies, run PM2 deamon.

* Please describe yourself using either XML or JSON.

    JSON is an light weight, and most importantly it readable one. we can destructured the object easily
